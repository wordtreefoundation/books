Verse 1st. AND it came to pass in the reign of George the king, who ruled over Albion, and whose empire extended to the uttermost parts of the earth, that the spirit of Belial went forth among the sons of men, and people warred against people, and nation against nation, so that there was no peace in the land.

2d. For the tribe of Columbia had fallen off, saying one unto another, wherefore should the king of Albion rule over us as if we were his handmen, and the saying pleased the people.

3d. And there were amongst them certain cunning men, fair of speech, who stirred up sedition, saying, hearken unto our voice oh ! ye men of Columbia, for it is the voice of the Lord.

4th. Thus saith th eLord, shake off the yoke of Albion and the king thereof, and chuse unto yourselves judges and rulers out of your own tribe to govern you.

5th. And let them be wise and upright men, and they shall rule over you, but ye shall each of you do as seemeth good in his own eyes, and so shall ye be freemen, and not slaves.

6th. And all the people shouted with a great shout and cried aloud these men be wise and upright, and worthy to rule over us, and in that day they were chosen as judges and rulers over the people.

7th. And the rulers appointed captains of tens, and captains of hundreds and captains of thousands, and cried to your tents, O ! Columbia.

8th. Now when there came to Albion and the king thereof, he waxed exceeding wrath, and sent forth a mighty host of horsemen and footmen, fifty and two thousand fighting men sent he forth, all men of valour.

9th. But in their captains there was no faith, for they delivered the young men into the hands of the enemy to be led captives.

10th. Now when the nations of Cahia, Hispania and Belgia saw these things they made a league together that they might humble the sons of Albion, for they hated them because of their greatness.

11th. And each of them sent forth armed bands and ships so that the battles were sore against Albion, for none of the nations stood forth for them.

12th. Albeit, the king was grieved at heart, he slackened not, neither did he despond, but called unto him Nirod and Hanva, and made these captains over thousands and ten thousands.

13th. And unto Hanva he gave power over the land and unto Nirod over the water, and said go up now against mine enemeies in the west, even in the isles of the west, and smite them.

14th. So it came to pass as they went on their way, they looked and behold the sons of Hispania were apon the face of the great deep, but they fled before the sons of Albion for they were many, but the sons of Hispania were few.

15th. And so that day Nirod took many of their ships and destroyed many, so that of all the ships of Hispania very few did escape.

16th. Then went they on their way towards the isles of the west as the king had commanded, and lo ! the men of Gallia in many ships appeared in battle array.

17th. And they did fight once again; and retired to their strong holds, each boasting of his deeds, but no man wist which of them spake the truth, for they both claimed the victory.

18th. Howebeit the men of Gallia remained not, but went into a far country, then did Nirod sing the song of triumph, saying others have slain their thousands, but I have slain my ten thousands, and there is none like unto me.  (To be continued.)
